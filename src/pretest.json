			"question": "1. The water content of a soil sample cannot be determined by ____ method.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Oven Drying",
				"b": "Alcohol",
				"c": "Calcium Carbide",
				"d": "Pipette"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "This method can be used as is demonstrated by this very experiment.",
				"b": "This method is very similar to the oven drying method. Instead of using an oven to dry the soil, the sample is mixed with a methylated spirit and heated with constant stirring. Clearly, this method can be used for water content determination.",
				"c": "This method can be used for water content determination. To know more about this method, <a href='https://www.engineeringcivil.com/determining-water-content-in-soil-calcium-carbide-method.html' target='_blank'>click here</a>.",
				"d": "The pipette method is the standard sedimentation method used in laboratory for wet mechanical or sedimentation analysis and cannot be used for water content determination."

		{
			"question": "2. In the oven drying method, the soil sample is kept for about ____ hours in the oven.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "1",
				"b": "2",
				"c": "24",
				"d": "48"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Some soil types may take longer and hence 1 hour is not sufficient in general.",
				"b": "Some soil types may take longer and hence 2 hours is not sufficient in general.",
				"c": "For complete drying, sandy soil takes about 4 hours and fat clays take about 14 to 16 hours. To assure complete drying of the sample for any type of soil, it is kept for about 24 hours.",
				"d": "48 hours is an excessive amount of time and the soil can be dried in much lesser time for any soil type."

		{
			"question": "3. The values of water content for natural granular soils vary from less than 0.1% for air dry sands to more than 40% for saturated sands.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "True",
				"b": "False"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Water content depends on the relative density of soil.",
				"b": "Water content depends on the relative density of soil."
